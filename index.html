          today we are gonna be talking about my 3 of my most favourites games!
        </p>

      <div class="child">
        <h3>Far Cry 5:</h3>
        <p>
          This game is one of my all-time favorites, partly due to the emotional
          connection I had while playing. The visuals are stunning, and although
          the story is just okay, the soundtrack, visuals, lighting, and
          location truly captivated me.

        <h3>Dying Light:</h3>

        <p>
          I don't usually play zombie games, but this one was surprisingly good.
          The co-op support made it enjoyable with a friend, and the story,
          especially with the DLC, was excellent. It's now in my top 3 games.

      <div class="child">
        <h3>Sleeping Dogs:</h3>
        <p>
          now many may think its another copy of gta 5. in my opinion it was
          much more than that. the hand to hand martial art really felt fun to
          play. also the lighting was very good. story was definitely on the
          higher end. overall really enjoyed the game!
