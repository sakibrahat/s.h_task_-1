        <p>Today we are gonna be talking about 3 of my most favorite games!</p>

        <h3>Far Cry 5:</h3>
        <p>
          This game is one of my all-time favorites, partly due to the emotional
          connection I had while playing. The visuals are stunning, and although
          the story is just okay, the soundtrack, visuals, lighting, and
          location truly captivated me.

        <h3>Dying Light:</h3>

        <p>
          I don't usually play zombie games, but this one was surprisingly good.
          The co-op support made it enjoyable with a friend, and the story,
          especially with the DLC, was excellent. It's now in my top 3 games.

      <div class="child">
        <h3>Sleeping Dogs:</h3>
        <p>
          Now many may think it's another copy of GTA 5. In my opinion, it was
          much more than that. The hand-to-hand martial arts really felt fun to
          play. Also, the lighting was very good. The story was definitely on
          the higher end. Overall, I really enjoyed the game!
